These 3 codes are for the first project of Digital communication.
Including:
  1. Performance of QPSK and 4PAM constellation ---- Task 1
  2. Constellations design with the ML decision regions for M = 4 and 8.
  3. Performance comparison with 4PAM, QPSK, 8PSK based on theoretical
  4. Performance comparison with 4PAM, QPSK, 8PSK based on simulation
